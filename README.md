# translate with API's
I wrote these scripts to translate Russian texts to English which simplifies data analysis on data provided in the forecast sales competition on Kaggle. You need to add the API key to your environment variables. Use the following variable names: TRANSLATOR_YANDEX_API_KEY and/or TRANSLATOR_WATSON_API_KEY.
